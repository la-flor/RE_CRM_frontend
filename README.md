# General 
This website and web app features a functional CRM for tracking real estate leads for real estate investors or wholesalers.

The website features information about the company and their acquisition process. This serves as a funnel in marketing the business and features a submission form for potential sellers to provide contact information and basic information on their property.

The administration has a seperate web app that allows them to track and document leads through the process of speaking with the potential sellers.

The initial deployment will be solely a frontend user website that allows them to submit leads to be added to our database. Future deployments will include the admin user interface for more advanced features and functionality.
